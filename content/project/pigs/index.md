Precision swine farming has the potential to directly benefit both farmers and pigs through monitoring the pigs' health and growth.
We deploy our [GeoMCU](/projects/geomcu/) sensors in pig pens, forming a failure-tolerant sensing network.
Using these detected vibrations, we can monitor piglet growth and activity, nursing behavior, sow weight, and more.
