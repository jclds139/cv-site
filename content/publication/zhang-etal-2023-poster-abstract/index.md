abstract: Object classification is a vital technology that is widely used to track
  and identify misplaced and out-of-stock items in shopping centers. While there have
  been a number of studies utilizing various sensing modalities such as computer vision,
  RFID, and vibration sensors, these methods are limited in their use due to privacy
  concerns, scalability, and the inability to identify stationary objects. To overcome
  these limitations, we propose a novel active vibration-sensing approach for object
  classification by utilizing music as an excitation source. Different objects can
  induce different deformations of the surface and further change the surface structural
  response. Therefore, we leverage vibrations from music on a store shelf and measure
  the structural responses on the surface when different objects are placed. Our evaluation
  of a store shelf demonstrates that distinct object characteristics lead to unique
  vibration responses, enabling accurate classification of 98.6% accuracy in distinguishing
  five common store objects. This study provides a promising avenue for a reliable,
  privacy-preserving, and scalable object classification system in various settings
  beyond shopping centers.
