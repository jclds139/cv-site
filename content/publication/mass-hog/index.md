abstract: In the swine livestock industry, weight tracking is commonly used to track
  health and growth of pigs. This is especially crucial during the farrowing period,
  where mother sows and their newborn piglets are housed together to facilitate nursing.
  Existing weight measurement methods, however, either provide only sporadic snapshots
  or have scalability and reliability issues in the harsh environment of industrial
  farms. This paper presents MassHog, a multi-layered system for ubiquitous weight
  measurement in harsh environments, such as pig pens, using structural vibrations.
  MassHog combines an existing sensor concept with actuated vibrations to weigh both
  piglets and adult hogs together. We evaluate the components of this system through
  testing deployments, including at real-world operating pig farms. Preliminary results
  show less than 2 kg mean absolute error for adult hogs.
