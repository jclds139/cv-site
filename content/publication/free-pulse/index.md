abstract: Heart rate is a critical metric for human cardiovascular health. Most common
  methods for measuring human heart rate involve wearable devices (e.g., electrocardiography,
  smart watches). However, such devices can cause discomfort to some patients, especially
  the elderly or young children. This paper presents FreePulse, a heart rate monitoring
  system for seated subjects using ambient vibrations. FreePulse builds on our past
  work using vibrations in the building structures around us to measure human activities
  and health. As people's hearts beat, they push on the surfaces the body is touching,
  creating vibrations in those structures. We combine structure response characterization
  with human pulse modelling to identify these pulse-induced vibrations from ambient
  vibration. In testing, FreePulse has shown up to 96% pulse rate accuracy on average,
  competitive with consumer-grade wearable devices.
